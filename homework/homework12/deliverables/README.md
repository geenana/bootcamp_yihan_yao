# Deliverables Overview

## Audience
This report is written for **stakeholders and decision-makers** who need to quickly understand model results, risks, and implications for strategy. The goal is to avoid technical jargon while still keeping transparency around assumptions and sensitivities.  

## Rationale
The chosen audience typically does not read raw code or statistical outputs. Instead, they prefer **concise takeaways, visuals, and decision-focused insights** that directly connect analysis to action.  

## Why Markdown?
- **Lightweight & Portable**: Markdown is easy to render in many platforms and doesn’t require special software.  
- **Supports Visuals**: Charts and sensitivity tables are embedded for clarity.  
- **Editable & Transparent**: Analysts can easily update assumptions, results, and visuals without reformatting overhead.  

This format ensures that stakeholders get **clear insights, visual evidence, and context on assumptions** — all in a format that can evolve as analysis continues.

    "- What stage of the lifecycle was hardest for you, and why?\n",

    "**1. Hardest Stage:**  \n",
    "The most challenging stage was **Feature Engineering and Modeling**. Handling volatility regime shifts, aligning macroeconomic lags with daily market data, and preventing overfitting required careful iterative testing. Choosing appropriate windows for rolling metrics and validating engineered features demanded both domain knowledge and statistical intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Most Reusable Repo Components:**  \n",
    "- **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering Functions**: Scripts in `/src/` for calculating `rv_21d_pct`, `vrp_ratio`, and `rate_shock_5d_bps`.  \n",
    "- **Model Training & Evaluation Modules**: Functions for regression modeling and backtesting are modular and can be applied to other financial time series.  \n",
    "- **Data Ingestion Utilities**: Functions for fetching Yahoo Finance and FRED data can be reused with minor modifications.  \n",
    "- **Dashboard & API Templates**: Streamlit and Flask code can be adapted for other predictive analytics projects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Handoff to a Teammate:**  \n",
    "To help a teammate pick up the repo quickly:  \n",
    "- **Clear folder structure** (`/data/`, `/src/`, `/notebooks/`, `/docs/`)  \n",
    "- **README.md** with instructions for running notebooks, training models, and launching dashboards  \n",
    "- **Commented, modular code** in `/src/` so tasks can be executed independently  \n",
    "- **Requirements.txt** for reproducibility  \n",
    "- **Sample data or mock dataset** so they can test scripts without downloading full historical datasets  \n"

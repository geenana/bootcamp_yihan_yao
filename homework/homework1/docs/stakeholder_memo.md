# Stakeholder Memo: Predicting Stock Market Volatility Project 
**To:** Portfolio Manager (Stakeholder) 
**From:** Research Team, NYU 

## Problem Context 
There is a concern about anticipating market volatility in order to manage portfolio risk expousures more effectively. Volatility spikes 
directly affect hedging costs and capital allocation, especially under tightening financial conditions. 

## Decision Context 
Decision Owner: Portfolio Manager (PM) 
End Users: Risk analysts producing weekly forecasts and reports 
Decision Window: Weekly updates aligned with trading committee review 

## Proposed Solution 
We will develop a predictive framework to forecast short-term stock market volatility. The model will incorporate macroeconomic indicators 
such as interest rates, inflation, and unemployment alongside market signals. Deliverables will include predictive intervals, scenario 
dashboards, and risk alerts. 

## Assumptions 
- Timely access to Yahoo Finance and FRED data 
- Weekly refresh frequency is sufficient for decision-making 
- Model will be designed for interpretability and robustness 
- Analysis is feasible with data and current computing resources 

## Risks 
- Data lags in macro indicators 
- Structural regime shifts in volatility dynamics 
- Potential mismatch between historical relationships and current market conditions 
- Potential missing data and model overfitting issue 

## Next Steps 
- Confirm scope and decision window with PM 
- Begin data collection and processing 
- Deliver initial descriptive analysis before predictive modeling 
- Build models and conduct evaluation 
- Report results to PM

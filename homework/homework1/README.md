# Predicting Stock Market Volatility using Macroeconomic Indicators
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

## Problem Statement
Financial markets are highly unpredictable, and volatility is one of the most critical measures of risk for portfolio managers, traders, and risk officers. Anticipating periods of high volatility allows investors to adjust portfolio allocations and manage risks. The challenge is that volatility is influenced by both market dynamics and macroeconomic shocks, making it difficult to predict accurately. 

This project seeks to forecast near-term stock market volatility by analyzing VIX index and realized volatility of the S&P 500 and incorporating macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, inflation, and unemployment. By understanding the drivers of volatility and building predictive models, we can provide actionable insights for investment decision-making and risk management. 

## Stakeholder & User
Decision owner: a portfolio manager (PM) responsible for asset allocation and risk exposure decisions 
Users: portfolio manager + risk analysts who operate forecasting tools and generate weekly market reports 
The workflow requires a weekly or monthly updates to adjust portfolios in anticipation of volatility spikes. 

## Useful Answer & Decision
Predictive: estimating near-term volatility levels with confidence intervals 
Metric: predicted near-term volatility, confidence bands, probability of breaking thresholds 
Artifact: forecasting model, scenario-based dashboards, risk alerts that indicate when defined thresholds are breached 

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Data availability: market data (S&P 500, VIX) is accessible via Yahoo Finance; macro data via FRED 
- Stationarity: assumes stable data pipeline and statistical properties of volatility are reasonably stable within the analysis horizon; crisis or calm periods 
(regime shifts) may break this assumption 
- Stable relationships: assumes macroeconomic indicators have stable and interpretable relationships with volatility over time; the correlation may change during 
crisis or calm periods 
- Capacity: assumes analysis is feasible with publicly available data and academic computing resources 
- Compliance: data sources are public and do not raise compliance issues 
- Runtime: computation should run on local machine without requiring large clusters 
- Latency: market data is available with minimal delay; macro indicators are published monthly and introduce reporting lags; assumes weekly refresh is sufficient 
for decision-making 

## Known Unknowns / Risks
- Macro data publication lag (monthly vs daily frequency)
- Model overfitting to past volatility shocks 
- Uncertainty in macro due to market volatility causal linkage; monitor by re-estimaing causal coefficients quarterly 
- Regime shifts may break some of the assumptions mentioned above; monitor by checking regime probability from Markov-switching model and setting criteria for 
switching to "crisis" mode and inflating prediction interval width by a chosen factor 
- Potentially missing data; monitor by creating a daily dashboard recording %missing, %zeros, duplicate rows 

## Lifecycle Mapping
Goal → Stage → Deliverable
- Goal: Define volatility forecasting problem → Problem Framing & Scoping → Scoping paragraph + stakeholder context artifact + repo skeleton 
- Goal: Collect and clean data → Data Acquisition/Ingestion & Data Storage → Clean + aligned datasets in /data/
- Goal: Explore data and engineer features → Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering → Realized volatility metrics and regime indicators 
- Goal: Build and evaluate models → Modeling & Evaluation → Forecasting models for realized volatility + backtesting results 
- Goal: Communicate insights to stakeholders → Results Reporting & Delivery Design → Dashboards + risk alerts + summary report
